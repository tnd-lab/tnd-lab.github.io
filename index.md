## Telecom Neural Detection (TND) Lab

At TND Lab, we focus on harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to advance telecommunication and radar detection. By exploring the statistical and stochastic characteristics of wireless channels and waveforms, we apply these findings to create more reliable and effective AI/ML-powered solutions tailored for telecom and radar systems.

## Open Source

We openly share the source code for most of our papers with the research community, encouraging transparency and enabling reproducible research. Beyond that, we also hope our shared materials can be useful to students and researchers in academia.

The source code can be found on these GitHub repositories:
- [github.com/tnd-lab](https://github.com/tnd-lab?tab=repositories)
- [github.com/trinhudo](https://github.com/trinhudo?tab=repositories)
